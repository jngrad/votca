VOTCA-CSG is a collection of tools, which help you to develop coarse
grained interaction potential from atomistic reference simulations using
force-matching, boltzmann inversion and others.

Further information on VOTCA can be found at http://www.votca.org

The development of VOTCA is mainly funded by academic research grants.
